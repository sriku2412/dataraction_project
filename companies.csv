To achieve this, we are transforming the way investment services professionals work, so they are equipped to deliver better results for their clients. As a Financial Advisor, the decisions you make have a lasting impact on your clients and their ability to achieve their financial goals. You must be able to assess and compare investment options efficiently to ensure you’re selecting the right portfolio to suit your client’s asset allocation. Today, however, the tedious, largely manual processes in the sales cycle can hinder your acuteness to the market, changing regulations, and client goals. This means not being able to get the information you need; making it harder to analyze funds and potentially leading to missed financial goals for your clients. We’ve developed a product to change that. CapIntel is a modernized platform that bridges sales process gaps and stamps out inefficiencies so advisors can attend to their clients’ needs more effectively and help them enhance their financial future. We empower each level of the firm’s sales force with the tools needed to get the job done, including modelling investment comparisons, preparing compelling proposals, and tracking compliance checkpoints. In short, our product facilitates an ecosystem that reflects the workflows of each wealth enterprise. Diversity builds better teams, and we encourage individuals of all backgrounds to reach out to us if you're interested in working together.","Toronto, ON, Canada",https://cdn.filestackcontent.com/1uKr3FDbQSAnmn0U2EEd,"11-50, Female founded, Finance, SaaS, Service, Software","Finance, Information Technology, Media, Software",other,3,3

Ionomr,"Ionomr is pioneering and commercializing the world's most advanced ion-exchange materials. These provide an enabling platform for clean tech solutions after more than five decades of stagnation in available materials. Using our deep knowledge of scalable electrochemical systems, we enable more efficient systems that will lead to the decarbonization of the planet for future generations. To date, electrochemical applications in the clean tech realm use materials that contain toxic fluorinated chemicals (PFCs). PFCs leach into water sources and bioaccumulate for hundreds of years, having a dire impact on human health and the entire ecosystem. We are driven to replace these materials with our environmentally friendly hydrocarbon alternatives that reduce pollution at the source, and are proven to be more durable and efficient than incumbent materials. Ionomr's membranes and polymers are highly processable, which allow for simple integration into electrochemical systems. We enable optimal performance in applications for chemical & water remediation, energy storage and hydrogen.

Help individuals start healthy financial behaviours that have long-term, lasting impacts. Our story. Founded in 2018, the vision for Olive began with founder Dave Beaton who is a pioneer in the payment rounding space. Over the past decade, Dave built rounding platforms for BMO, RBC and many credit unions. Since incorporating, Olive has secured IP, large B2B partners, influential advisors along with a passionate group of Board members. As a team, we have set out to build Olive as a Financial Technology (“Fintech”) company focused on getting more people to start giving or to start saving for their future as a function of their daily spending. With reports of personal savings shrinking, and strong indicators that millennials are spending more than they are saving (41% of people aged 20 to 36 have $0 in savings) it means there is an opportunity to help everyone take those first steps towards their financial goals. From this Olive’s vision to power positive financial behaviours for consumers everywhere was born. Today, Olive offers a world-class Card-Linking-as-a-Service (“CLaaS”) that is about to power the rounding of purchase transactions into savings, investment and donation accounts for partners who themselves service over 50 million people.","Waterloo, ON, Canada",https://cdn.filestackcontent.com/2y14zOB3RJWDl3Yxp8Xn,"1-9, B2B, Data & analytics, Finance, SaaS, Software","Finance, Information Technology, Software",other,2,2

Nureva Inc.,"Our customers just want to get down to work – no hassles, no drama, no user manual. So we develop innovative audio conferencing systems that make it easy to stay connected, from anywhere. With Nureva audio, you can be heard in every part of a room, no matter how far apart you are. There’s no need for shared mics or complex technical setups. It’s all thanks to Microphone Mist technology, the brains behind every Nureva audio conferencing system. The technology leaps past beamforming systems, filling a space with thousands of virtual microphones so everyone can spread out and still be heard. And with quick DIY installation options and continuous autocalibration, Nureva audio systems are easy to use and adaptable – making them an ideal match for today’s meeting rooms and classrooms. Our active and growing patent portfolio makes it clear that at Nureva, we aren’t interested in making tweaks to someone else’s idea. We would rather dream big and develop brand new technologies that challenge the status quo. Whether ideas emerge from a hackathon, our R&D team or a conversation around our office’s kitchen table, we are driven to approach problems from a fresh perspective. Our customers include global enterprises, small businesses, postsecondary institutions and school districts around the world. They are our teachers – their experiences act as our blueprints and their problems drive our design decisions. We’re always looking for smart, collaborative people to join our team.

About our founders – Nureva is a private company founded in 2014 by technology veterans, David Martin (chairman and CTO) and Nancy Knowlton (CEO), the founders and visionaries behind SMART Technologies over its first 25 years.

Dave is driven by a deep understanding of technology trends and how technology solutions can make life better in the classroom and at work.

Our Vision to revolutionize home health care; to create a world where people can live out their lives in the comfort of their own homes. Nearly 90 percent of seniors want to stay in their own homes as they age, often referred to as “aging in place” but the majority cannot accomplish this. This means that the majority of the 46 million North American seniors cannot live their golden years in the location of their choosing - a problem that Mavencare is determined to address. We believe that everyone has the right to age in the comfort of their own home. And that’s why Mavencare was born.","Toronto, ON, Canada",https://cdn.filepicker.io/api/file/aeHZ56TmSdCxOAEOD5ot,"B2C, C100 alumni, Marketplace, Medical/life sciences, Software",Health,series_a,3,2

Goodpin,"Stop Marketing. Start Mattering. Goodpin is a web-based marketing tool that lets your company give charitable funds to consumers, who then give it to a charity they choose. The consumer then easily posts to social media about your company and their cause, making everyone involved look good. And these social posts are 10x more viewed and 1000x more engaged when compared to traditional paid digital marketing approaches. How do you give funds away? You can either email funds to specific individual(s) or offer for it to be taken in small amounts from a web-based campaign. The platform takes care of all the back office functions like managing the charity list, sending funds to the charities, providing tax receipts, recording all the donations, and providing metrics. Just like other web-based marketing tools, Goodpin charges a monthly fee. You simply load up your Goodpin account with funds, from either your charity or marketing budget, and give it away. Initiating a connection by “giving together” creates trust with consumers, and fosters goodwill. It results in measurably more sales and increased Customer Lifetime Value. It also creates more community awareness that your company is doing good, which is the biggest requirement by the new generation of consumers and employees.","Calgary, AB, Canada",https://cdn.filestackcontent.com/UtigX1A5QYWYCRDFsYWk,"B2C, Consumer & lifestyle, Marketplace, Social enterprise, Software",Sales and Marketing,pre_seed,1,1

Talem Health Analytics,"Talem is an artificial intelligence company focusing on crash, injury, and billing analysis within auto claims. The core mission is the development of novel, value-add solutions for insurers surrounding the prediction, treatment, payment, and adjudication of claims involving bodily injuries. We are relentlessly focused on bringing innovation to the bodily injury arena in a fashion similar to those who have brought innovations to address damage to the vehicle before us. The foundation of the Talem platform was built to analyze photos of vehicles post-accident and deliver predictions related to the impact, forces, and damage to the human body – rather than the vehicle. This foundation and additional feature set are specifically designed to materially impact key areas of the claim lifecycle through a data-driven focus on injury causation and the recovery of an injured party. What we have learned throughout our journey is that insurers do not have a solid grasp of injuries until late in the claim lifecycle. This reactive approach to bodily injury management opens opportunities for the increased claim and operational costs, a growing number of open claims, and a higher likelihood of undetected fraud. Talem's approach provides a fundamental shift to earlier, more proactive management and data-driven insights which has proven to be successful. We have demonstrated up to a 90% reduction of service referral time, 50% reduction of adjuster handle time for medical bill processes, greater than 500k annual handle time savings, and an indication of 50% savings on services with a Talem subscription vs traditional transactional approach. To execute on our vision we have assembled a team of experts in injury science, technology, and insurance operations. Our team members have, on average, twenty years of experience in the management of automotive injuries, medical claims management, end-to-end insurance services and operations, occupant kinematics, injury causation and rehabilitation, and highly sophisticated data & analytics tools and methods. Including, but not limited to, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), Natural Language Processing (NLP), Intelligent Document Processing (IDP), and Optical/Intelligent Character Recognition (O/ICR).","Halifax, NS, Canada, Sydney, NS, Canada, Boston, MA, USA",https://cdn.filestackcontent.com/Pg4IfG5mS5uh1K98zOwM,"AI/ML, B2B, Data & analytics, Medical/life sciences, Software","DeepTech, Finance, Health, Information Technology, Software, Transportation",seed,1,0

This creates a backlog of sick patients, and a dramatic increase in diabetic foot wounds, related amputations and mortality. we need to start preparing for what comes next. The MIMOSA device solution is a connected care platform that enables the patient and physician to communicate remotely for assessment and triage of diabetic foot ulcers. There is no current product available within the Canadian market that provides the same standardized remote monitoring components within 1 personal medical device, hence the need for the MIMOSA device under the current market conditions. There are diabetic monitoring products available that measure, in isolation, data points such as temperature, oxygenation etc, but the MIMOSA device has the ability to measure all pertinent components of standardized global diabetic foot ulcer monitoring.","Toronto, ON, Canada",https://cdn.filestackcontent.com/hU9nh9jeQ3WdB7jOPYkk,"B2B, Female founded, Hardware (non-robotics), Healthcare & wellness","Hardware, Health, Manufacturing",seed,2,0

AA,"Our story at BizBiz Share started on an oil sand site in northern Alberta. The site was host to roughly 100 contractors. One day, with temperatures near -40 Celsius, a group of us were working on a culvert when one of our skid-steer's hydraulic systems exploded! The work had to be halted for 2 days before a new skid-steer could be shipped to us. One thought our founder couldn’t shake off was that the very same skid-steer was just sitting idle, collecting snow instead of being put to work. What if we could have just leased it temporarily? And so, the idea was born; a platform that allows companies to work together and gain access to the resources they need and optimize the efficiency of what they own This synergy benefits our economy, businesses and our environment. BizBiz Share is now Canada’s largest resource marketplace, with over 1000 members and over $100 000 000 in resources.","Montreal, QC, Canada, Lachine, Montreal, QC, Canada",https://cdn.filestackcontent.com/SUGPsmziQwYYzrGSy05k,"Marketplace, B2B, Software, Agnostic (all), Productivity",Software,other,1,0

Partnered with both Microsoft and HPE, Kognitiv Spark's flagship software, RemoteSpark, allows organizations to support their remote technicians like never before. Provide remote technicians the support they need to complete any task, anywhere, any time. RemoteSpark is the market’s most secure and reliable industrial remote guidance tool leveraging a full Mixed Reality environment. Using RemoteSpark on HoloLens 1 or 2, remote technicians can communicate with subject matter experts, through a secure, low-bandwidth audio/video connection, when they need assistance completing a complex task.

Trusted by organizations including the Royal Canadian Navy and Surepoint Group, experts can see what the remote technician sees and drag and drop CAD assets, PDFs, or Microsoft Office documents into the worker’s field of view. This content appears as 3D holograms in the end user’s real-world environment. RemoteSpark operates full Mixed Reality support calls in internet bandwidth conditions as low as 256kbps and boasts industrial-grade security infrastructure. Designed to accommodate your organization’s data governance policies, RemoteSpark can operate both in the cloud and on-premise. Advanced use cases include holographic IoT integration. This Mixed Reality tool allows industrial organizations to: • Reduce unplanned equipment downtime - Keep your systems running. Remote technicians can perform tasks like system experts. Tasks are completed faster and with more accuracy. • Facilitate knowledge transfer - Learn by doing. Every RemoteSpark call is a one-on-one, on-the-job training session between a subject matter expert and a technician. • Reduce unplanned expert travel - A subject matter expert can guide a field technician from the comfort of their office, eliminating the cumbersome remote troubleshooting of the past and reducing the need to travel on site. • Improve task interpretation, reduce mental fatigue - Make task interpretation easy. With Mixed Reality, reduce the time required to interpret 2D instructions by converting task supporting assets into 3D, multi-step animated holograms that appear in the work’s real-world environment.","Fredericton, NB, Canada",https://cdn.filepicker.io/api/file/lDFZR64fSzSAgOYmGw8d,"B2B, Education, Industrial, Software","DeepTech, Finance, Hardware, Information Technology, Software, Travel",series_a,2,0

CloudMask,"CloudMask is a Software as a Service (SaaS) solution. Using patent-pending methods, CloudMask, running on user devices, transparently intercepts and analyses data to identify, tokenize, and encrypt sensitive information. The intercepted data may belong to a variety of applications, such as Google, SalesForce, Box, and MS Office 365 and practically any other application you could be using. CloudMask converts your sensitive data to tokens that have the same structure as the original data but are meaningless, jumbled texts bearing no relation to the original data. As a result, the application receives meaningless tokens, instead of the original private data. These tokens do not break the application’s functionality, nor can it be broken by any cryptanalysis. Accordingly, the application continues to function as before and security is transparent, without requiring any changes to existing applications. CloudMask protects you against unauthorized disclosure and vendor misuse of the data as well. These techniques also apply to on-premise applications, and accordingly CloudMask mitigates insider threats by utilizing user-owned keys (asymmetric key pair). These keys are never shared or transmitted over the network. Only users/systems explicitly authorized by the data owner may use their personal keys to restore tokens back to their meaningful data. One of the biggest competitive advantage of CloudMask is its scalability. This is needed not only to address the top of the pyramid, such as governments and large enterprise. But it is also very important when offering a cloud service to potentially millions of users, and even more devices. CloudMask is a Common Criteria certified. Common Criteria is a global security certification that approved by 26 governments, demonstrating that the user data remains private even if the network, application and CloudMask servers are fully compromised. Now to complete the picture, our long term vision is to expand the model to cover Internet of Things devices. In other words there is no reason to limit our space to end-user, we want to protect private information no matter where their being created.","Ottawa, ON, Canada",https://cdn.filestackcontent.com/un5tGf3hRHiTPWXJLyUP,"B2B, Cybersecurity, Software","Information Technology, Software",seed,1,0

We believe that by unlocking data already available on your health network, intelligent analytics can be delivered to any user from a single source, where and when the information is needed - simple, cost effective and powerful. Bialogics has developed a state-of-the-art data management tool that securely and efficiently gathers data from typically isolated information management systems.

Applied Brain Research,"Applied Brain Research Inc is the maker of Nengo, a neuromorphic artificial intelligence interactive development environment for building neural computing applications. Neuromorphic computing is an emerging computing architecture which uses artificial neurons to compute like the brain does, massively parallel and low-power. AI networks built on neuromorphic hardware and software compute with less power and use more continuous states as opposed to discrete weight updates as machine learning algorithms do. The benefit is that applications built this way can use less power, be more responsive and more accurate. The neuromorphic architecture allows real-time integration of multiple AI networks into integrated, large, functional systems. Full-loop AI systems can be built with Nengo such as Spaun, the world's largest functional brain simulation. Spaun is ABR's research platform for full-loop service robotics. ABR is first commercializing Nengo as the compiler and runtime for the new generation of neuromorphic chips such as the Intel Loihi, Spinnaker and BrainDrop, as well as ABR's library of neuromorphic applications for these chips such as Reach for robotic reaching, Vision, Speech built on ABR's neuromorphic AI algorithms (spiking deep learning, reinforcement learning, adaptive control, ....). ABR's long run goal is to build its neuromorphic platform into a truly functional service robotic operating system, starting with ABR Reach and guided by the learnings from ABR's research into Spaun.

This new perspective would make procedures faster by eliminating the iterative nature of navigation and safer by reducing guidewire induced punctures of arteries and veins. The harmless visible light would reduce the quantity of fluoroscopy and iodine required for these procedures.

INGU,"Currently, inline inspection in the oil and gas sector is a series of staged engineering events, designed to assess the condition of pipeline assets. It is costly, infrequent, and only addresses those lines that are within reach. In fact, it is estimated that 40% of the world’s pipelines are unpiggable. The vulnerabilities between inspections, which are typically years apart, or the inability to conduct inspections at all, puts the world’s aging pipeline infrastructure at risk. In order to address these issues, we have focused on changing the economics, the technology, and the workflow associated with inline inspection. We have introduced the industry’s first self-serve inspection model that eliminates significant engineering and downtime costs. We have developed miniature, multi sensor Pipers technology that freely flows within any and all active pipelines, regardless of location, condition, material or configuration. This technology is capable of inspecting pipelines as small as 2 inches in diameter, and surveying for leaks, geometric defects, magnetic anomalies, and deposits in a single run.

HeadCheck Health,"HeadCheck Health is changing the world by making effective concussion testing and protocol implementation easier. Further, it enables team/league administrators to make informed actionable decisions that increase player safety and minimize concussion mismanagement risk by providing an objective method to know if their concussion protocol is effective. The product itself, HeadCheck, is a complete solution for teams/leagues at all levels of play and sport-focused clinics that are looking for a better way to implement and execute concussion protocols. It includes an easy-to-use mobile software that simplifies standardized test methods, onboarding services (e.g. assisted baseline testing, training, certification of users), and compliance reporting. HeadCheck’s mobile application is used by teams for pre-season baseline testing, post-injury testing following suspected head injuries, and tracking recovery towards RTP. Tests are based off today’s most scientifically-backed methods and include 10 concussion indicators, such as: symptoms, cognitive function, vestibular-ocular motor screening, and standing balance. For organizations without medical staff, testing methodology and decision-making abilities are limited to what is appropriate for lay individuals, allowing them to make appropriate decisions and collect important information to support external medical professionals. Test results can be instantly compared to previous results, such as baseline tests, for a personalized view of the athlete’s concussive status. Results can also be securely shared with parents, coaches, or other medical professionals involved in the well-being of the athlete. Test results and notes follow athletes from team-to-team and sport-to-sport, allowing for informed decisions regardless of when or where an injury occurs throughout their life. Monthly and year-end compliance reporting provides administrators objective findings from team and user-specific analyses, such as whether teams are regularly testing, how many games are being lost from concussion, teams/users with inappropriate testing or protocol adherence, and whether certain fields/arenas report higher rates of concussive injury. Sport-focused clinicians such as physiotherapists, athletic therapists, and chiropractors have begun to expand in-clinic offerings to provide baseline, post-injury, and RTP concussion management. The goal is to provide a standardized tool for clinics to implement best practice concussion care with their patients, increase brand awareness and loyalty with clinicians, and increase the number of athletes being actively managed on the platform. This program is meant to compliment the Company’s team/league product and generate the mass-adoption and awareness required to make HeadCheck the de-facto standard for concussion testing and management in sport.","Toronto, ON, Canada, Calgary, AB, Canada, Vancouver, BC, Canada, Quebec City, QC, Canada, Ottawa, ON, Canada, Denver, CO, USA, Chicago, IL, USA, Dallas, TX, USA",https://cdn.filestackcontent.com/mytxrCz7RJiCKUZA9R0j,"10-49, B2B, Data & analytics, Female founded, Medical/life sciences, SaaS, Software","Blockchain and Crypto, Gaming, Health, Software, Sports",seed,2,0

Fulfil.IO,"*Helping retailers deal with growth* Growth happens and growth makes a lot of things more difficult - people don't know each other as well, customer service finds it harder to co-ordinate with the warehouse, communication becomes muddled, it becomes harder to stay on top of everything that's going on, etc. What worked for 3 or 5 people, doesn't work as well at 6 or 8. And certainly not 10, 15, 25 or more. At some point, these businesses need a system, something to stay organized, something to grow with so they don't lose control of themselves along the way. Order, shipments, purchase orders, inventory and financials need a single point of truth and a home. Most companies cobble together separate tools as they grow, but the weight of disorganization and lack of order collapses and eventually catches up to them. Sales does not know if something is shipped, purchasing doesn't know if a PO was received, accounting doesn't know if the items on an invoice was received and creates exponentially more meetings without the necessary structure and context to make it useful. This is where humans act as duct-tape and where Fulfil comes in.

BetaKit,"Something is missing in emerging technology reporting today. There’s a focus on amount of money raised instead of innovation and quality of a product or service. A wealth of coverage on what the big, established players are releasing next instead of reporting on what’s new and innovative. An emphasis placed on being first to report, rather than providing in-depth analysis. An echo chamber of Silicon Valley happenings with little attention paid to the rest of the world. Too much opinion and bias, not enough journalistic integrity. Enough is enough. At BetaKit, we care about providing the what, but we’re also committed to explaining why it matters. Breaking news is important, but so is relating news to larger industry trends, and telling you why you and your company should care. BetaKit is a new publication dedicated to providing original, real-time reporting and analysis of emerging technology news and global innovation. Built by the team behind Sprouter.com, BetaKit draws upon an established community of over 80,000 emerging technology founders who are building the next big thing. Find out what’s next, and what’s right now – from the people who see innovation as it happens.","Toronto, ON, Canada",https://cdn.filestackcontent.com/4zEYDwlSleWHcs3FRmSt,"Ecosystem organization, Media & entertainment","Finance, Media",other,2,0

Codename Entertainment,"Codename Entertainment was founded in 2008 in Victoria, B.C. by David Whittaker and Justin Stocks with the successful launch of their first title, ""Egg Breaker.""​ Egg Breaker's success hatched three successive games, Egg Breaker 2, Egg Drop and the current title in the series, Egg Breaker Adventures. Created in 2010, the classic Bush Whacker appealed to adventurers who were looking to smack some shrubbery and see what popped out. Following its success, Bush Whacker 2 was released in 2012 and celebrated its third anniversary earlier this year with much cake. It was not a lie. In 2015, the company launched Crusaders of the Lost Idols, a Canadian Videogames Awards 2015 Finalist, for players looking for an idle game of heroic awesomeness.","Victoria, BC, Canada",https://cdn.filestackcontent.com/31r2SdefQmWZkdDtYIcU,"10-49, Ar/VR & wearables, Gaming & esports, Software","Gaming, Media",other,2,0
